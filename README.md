# libSupport (1.2.1)
`libSupport` is like a toolbox for tinkering with apps. It's a dynamic library that lets you mess around with how different parts of an app work. It's not just for games â€“ it's for all sorts of apps. You can use it to intercept and change C functions, do cool stuff like code patching, and even figure out what's happening under the hood. So, if you're into tweaking apps to do things they weren't originally meant to, `libSupport` could be your go-to toolkit.

# Usage
- Files need to be added to `Frameworks` folder for jailed
- There is an example usage demo/jailed.mm check it out

# Why Isn't the libSupport Source Code Available?
I've chosen to keep the source code of libSupport hidden for a good reason. The aim here is to play a bit of hide-and-seek with those trying to find out what libSupport is all about. By keeping it under wraps, we're giving ourselves a head start, making it a bit more challenging for people outside to fully understand it.
