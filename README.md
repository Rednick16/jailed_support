# libSupport (1.2)
libSupport for jailed tweaks on non-jailbroken devices to bypass sideload detection.
and other checks developers have put in place.

# Usage
- Files need to be added to `Frameworks` folder for jailed
- There is an example usage demo/jailed.mm check it out
- If you are not a coder you can directly just inject the pre-compiled libSupport into an application using sideloadly.

# Where is libSupport source?
To prevent libSupport from being detected faster iv decided to keep source closed for now

# Please read
this is measly for educational purposes only please don't go moddifying other devlopers applications without permision.

# To-Do Check List
- add a custom info.plist file to link to
- add the original .app to link to, instead of checking the moddified one
- you tell me, will see
- Add some more bundleIdentifier checks SecTask etc and some semi CodePath techniques
